Overall, monitoring is an essential part of IT operations. It allows organizations to ensure that their systems are running smoothly and efficiently, and it helps to identify and troubleshoot problems quickly.



# Why is Monitoring.

Imagine having such a complex infrastructure with loads of servers distributed over many locations, 
and you have No insight into what is happening on the hardware level or on the application level like errors, 
response latency, hardware down, or overloaded, maybe running out of resources, etc.

In such complex infrastructure, there are more things that can go wrong. When you have tons of services and applications deployed, 
any one of them can crash and cause failure of other services, and you only have so many moving pieces, 
and suddenly the application becomes unavailable to users. You must quickly identify what exactly out of this 100s different 
things went wrong, and that could be difficult and time-consuming when debugging the system manually.

1.
So let's take a specific example. Say one specific **server ran out of memory** and kicked off a running container that was responsible 
for providing database sync between two database pods in a Kubernetes cluster. That, in turn, caused those two database pods to fail. 
That database was used by an authentication service that also stopped working because the database became unavailable, and then 
the application that depended on that authentication service couldn't authenticate users in the UI anymore. But from a user perspective, 
all you see is an error in the UI, can't log in.

So how do you know what actually went wrong when you don't have any insight into what's going on inside the cluster? 
You don't see that red line of the chain of events as displayed here; 
you just see the error. 

So now you start working backward from there to find the cause and fix it. So you check: 
Is the application back and running? Does it show an exception? 
Is the authentication service running? Did it crash? Why did it crash? 
All the way to the initial container failure. But what will make this searching the problem process more efficient would be to 
have a tool that constantly monitors whether services are running and alerts the maintainers as soon as one service crashes 
so you know exactly what happened. Or even better, it identifies problems before they even occur and alerts the system administrators 
responsible for that infrastructure to prevent that issue.
 
So, for example, in this case, it would check regularly the status of memory usage on each server, and when on one of the servers, 
it spikes over, for example, 70 percent for over an hour or keeps increasing, notify about the risk that the memory on that server might 
soon run out. Or let's consider another scenario where suddenly you stop seeing logs for your application because Elasticsearch 
doesn't accept any new logs because the server ran out of disk space or Elasticsearch reached the storage limit that was allocated for it.
Again, the monitoring tool would check continuously the storage space and compare it with the Elasticsearch consumption of space of 
storage, and it will see the risk and notify maintainers of the possible storage issue. And you can tell the monitoring tool what 
that critical point is when the alert should be triggered. For example, if you have a very important application that absolutely 
can't have any log data loss, you may be very strict and want to take measures as soon as 50 or 60 percent capacity is reached. 
Or maybe you know adding more storage space will take long because it's a bureaucratic process in your organization where you need 
approval of some IT department and several other people; then maybe you also want to be notified earlier about the possible storage issue.

So, a third scenario where the **application suddenly becomes too slow because** one service breaks down and starts sending hundreds of 
error messages in a loop across the network, that creates high network traffic and slows down other services too. Having a tool that 
detects such spikes in network load plus tells you which service is responsible for causing it can give you timely alert to fix the issue.

And such automated monitoring and alerting is exactly what Prometheus offers as a part of a modern DevOps workflow. 
So how does Prometheus actually work or how does its architecture actually look like?

# **Prometheus: Overview and Architecture**

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that is widely used in the DevOps and cloud-native ecosystem. It was developed by SoundCloud and later donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Prometheus is designed to 

Prometheus was created to **monitor highly dynamic container environments** like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc. However, 
it can also be used in a traditional non-container infrastructure where you have just bare servers with applications deployed 
directly on it. 
So over the past years, Prometheus has become the mainstream monitoring tool of choice in the container and 
microservice world.

**Key Features of Prometheus:**
1. **Multi-Dimensional Data Model:** Prometheus follows a multi-dimensional data model, where each data point is identified by a combination of key-value pairs. This allows for flexible and efficient querying and aggregation of metrics.

2. **Time-Series Database:** Prometheus stores time-series data natively, making it well-suited for monitoring time-based data such as metrics.

3. **PromQL:** Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) allows users to query and manipulate metrics data easily. It supports functions for aggregation, filtering, and mathematical operations.

4. **Pull-Based Architecture:** Prometheus follows a pull-based approach, where it periodically scrapes (pulls) metrics data from target applications and services. This enables it to work effectively in dynamic environments like Kubernetes.

5. **Service Discovery:** Prometheus integrates with various service discovery mechanisms like Kubernetes service discovery, Consul, and others to automatically discover and monitor new targets as they appear or disappear.

6. **Alerting:** Prometheus comes with a built-in alerting mechanism that allows users to define alerting rules based on metrics thresholds or other conditions. When an alert rule is violated, Prometheus can send alerts to various alerting channels like email, Slack, or PagerDuty.

# **Prometheus Architecture:**

Prometheus consists of several key components that work together to provide efficient monitoring capabilities:

1. **Prometheus Server:** The core component responsible for data collection and storage. It scrapes metrics data from configured targets using HTTP-based pull mechanism and stores the time-series data in its local **time-series database**. like CPU Uses, No of exceptions.

**Second**, it has a **data retrieval worker** that is responsible for getting or pulling those metrics from applications, services, servers, 
and other target resources and storing them or pushing them into that database.

And **third**, it has a web server or server API that accepts
 queries for that stored data, and that web server component or the server API is used to display the data in a dashboard or UI, either 
 through Prometheus dashboard or some other data visualization tool like Grafana.

2. **Pushgateway:** A service that allows ephemeral or batch jobs to push their metrics to Prometheus. This is useful for jobs that do not have long lifetimes or those that cannot be scraped directly by Prometheus.

3. **Exporters:** Prometheus exporters are small agents that run alongside the applications or services and expose their metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape. There are various exporters available for popular applications like Node Exporter (for system-level metrics), MySQL Exporter, Apache Exporter, etc.

4. **Alertmanager:** This component handles alerts generated by Prometheus. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and sending alerts to various alert notification channels.

5. **Prometheus Web UI:** A graphical user interface that allows users to explore metrics, execute queries, and visualize data using graphs and charts.

**Conclusion:**

Prometheus is a powerful monitoring solution with a flexible data model, scalable architecture, and a rich ecosystem of exporters and integrations. Its pull-based approach and service discovery capabilities make it well-suited for modern containerized environments like Kubernetes. With its effective alerting and visualization features, Prometheus empowers DevOps teams to gain valuable insights into their systems and applications, enabling them to detect and resolve issues proactively and ensure the smooth operation of their infrastructure.
